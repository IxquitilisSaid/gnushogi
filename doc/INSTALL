1. edit src/Makefile. For setting the paths, normally only
   HOME or LIBDIR and BINDIR need to be changed. Setting CC
   and CFLAGS sets C compiler and compiler options.

2. in src type 'make' and all programs will be made.
     (in case of a undefined _pow symbol use the -DOLDTIME option 
      for compiling search.c)

3. type 'make install' to install executables in BINDIR 
     and language files in LIBDIR

4. type 'make gnushogi.book.data' to build the binary book file.
     (the binary book file is created using gnushogir)

5. type 'make install' again to install binary book file in LIBDIR.
     (this installs the executables twice, never mind!)
