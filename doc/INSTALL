1. edit src/Makefile. For setting the paths, normally only
   HOME or LIBDIR and BINDIR need to be changed. Setting CC
   and CFLAGS sets C compiler and compiler options.

2. in src type 'make' and all programs will be make.
     (in case of a undefined _pow symbol use the -DOLDTIME option 
      for compiling search.c)

3. type 'make gnushogi.book.data' to build the binary book file.

4. type 'make install' to install in BINDIR and LIBDIR
