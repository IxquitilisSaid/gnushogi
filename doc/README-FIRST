GNU Shogi is the japanese version of chess. You can find the
rules of Shogi in "shogi.rules". This file and many other
shogi related stuff can be obtained from the SHOGI-L listserver (see
"listserv.ref"). If you would like to learn Shogi, you may
play some games following the game notations of the text book files.
You can find them in "../misc/*.book" and "../misc/shogi-l.games/*".
Especially "game01" and "game25" in "../misc/shogi-l.games" may serve
as introductiory games.

GNU Shogi is based on GNU Chess 4.0, i.e. the first
version of GNU Shogi has been obtained by "simply" modifying
the chess-specific parts of GNU Chess 4.0.

I would like to thank all people who have made the
sources of GNU Chess 4.0 available.
