Hello,

this is the first distribution of GNU Shogi. 

Please, send me a mail if you have received a copy.
I want to know, who is testing my program.

There are still some bugs in the program. Please, report them, if
a bug occurs. 

One note to edit board: You can enter mate problems, but it is not allowed
to leave a king off board. Therefore, place the black king on the board!.
