# Shogi Game 14 (professional, full annotation by professional).
# 
# The following is again a contribution from (mainly) Murooka Katsuhiko
# (just like games 3, 9, 11 and 12). This article is a good example of
# the achievement of teamwork: Murooka Katsuhiko played the game and did
# the analysis, Onno Brouwer wrote down everything that Murooka-san said,
# Pieter Stouten turned it into an article and Mike Sandeman corrected
# the English in most of the article. Here Murooka explains one of the
# games he played in the final league of the Judan (10-dan) Tournament.

# Black: Murooka Katsuhiko, 5-dan; White: Tsukada Yasuaki, 6-dan.
    1.P2f P8d   2.P2e P8e   3.G7h G3b   4.P2d Px2d   5.Rx2d P'2c
    6.R2f S6b (6. ... S7b is also possible)   7.P1f P1d
[ Instead of the exchange of edge pawn pushes, the following is possible:
  7.S3h P6d   8.P'2d Px2d   9.Rx2d. If white playes 9. ... P'2c black
  captures the pawn on 6d, so he plays 9. ... P1d and now: 10.P7f P8f
  11.Px8f Rx8f   12.P1f. Black threatens to take the pawn on 6d because
  he can answer 13. ... P'2h with 14.N1g. Play continues as follows:
  12. ... S6c   13.P1e Px1e   14.P'1d P'2c   15.R2e R8b   16.Rx1e and
  black has a better position. This brand new way of playing by black has
  been developed by Tsukada and he has won many games with it. Many more
  exciting variations are possible; we only give the main line here.]
    8.S3h P3d   9.P7f P5d
[ Mr. Tsukada avoids the variation given above, because he does not want
  to play against his own system. After 9.P7f there are three
  possibilities: 9. ... P5d or 9. ... P8f   10.Px8f Rx8f or 9. ... P6d
  10.R3f Bx8h+ (not 10. ... G3c   11.B7g, giving a slight positional
  advantage to black)  11.Sx8h B'2h   12.Rx3d Bx1i+   13.P'2b with
  advantage for black, but it is a very difficult position. For this
  variation 6. ... S7b would have been a better move because white's king
  has an easier way to escape then.]
   10.P4f S5c
[ P4f is better than P3f. White has opened the diagonal 7a-5c-1g, so
  black wants to exchange bishops, but he does not want to leave holes
  for white bishop drops.]
   11.Bx2b+ Sx2b
[ Black expects 11. ... P4d or P5e and he does noy like the resulting
  positions. So, although it loses a tempo, he exchanges bishops.]
   12.S8h P8f   13.Px8f Rx8f   14.P'8g
[ 14.B'7e is not good: 14. ... Rx7f   15.Bx5c+ Rx7h+ with advantage for
  white.]
   14. ... R8b   15.P3f
[ If black does not play P3f then white plays N3c/P2d/S2c. But if white
  plays 15. ... N3c now, then 16.P3e Px3e   17.P'3d follows.]
   15. ... G5b   16.K6h P4d   17.S4g G5b-4c
[ 17. ... G5b-4b, which is seen often after exchange of bishops, is not
  good because the pawn on 4d is weak.]
   18.G5h K4a   19.N3g K3a   20.P6f N3c   21.P9f P9d
[ Instead of 21.P9f the obvious move 21.S7g is not possible, because of
  21. ... P2d. White wants to play S2c/K2b now, so black captures the
  pawn on 2d. But then the following happens: 22. ... P'2e   23.Nx2e S2c
  24.Nx3c+ Sx2d   25.N'2c K4a   26.+Nx4c Gx4c   27.Nx1a+  and white has
  the initiative. He could drop his rook on 2i for example. If the silver
  were still on 8h, black could ignore this move, because after 28. ...
  Rx8i+ he would play G7i and white cannot afford to give black a rook in
  hand. Five years ago Futakami played in the same position against
  Nakahara 21.R2i and after 21. ... P2d he captured the pawn.]
   22.R2i K4a
[ Some players prefer 22. ... P5e. It is probably not good to play
  22. ... P7d: 23.P3e Px3e   24.B'6a R6b (after any other move black
  plays 25.P'3d)  25.Bx8c+ and black can capture the pawn on 7d.]
   23.S7g
[ Now this move is possible because, after 23. ... P2d   24.Rx2d P'2e
  25.Nx2e S2c   26.Nx3c=  is check.]
   23. ... K3a   24.N2e
[ Also possible is: 24.K7i P2d   25.K8h S2c, but then it has become very
  difficult for both black and white to attack.]
   24. ... P2d   25.Nx3c+ G3bx3c   26.G4h
[ Black wants to attack, so he first defends his weak squares on the
  right side.]
   26. ... P6d
[ If 26. ... K3b then 27.P3e Px3e   28.P'2f Px3f   29.Sx3f  is good for
  black. Now it is becoming clear why 26.G4h was necessary. If black had
  not played it either P'3g or B'3h would be possible.]
   27.P3e Px3e   28.P'3f P6e
[ The "semeai" (mutual attack) starts.]
   29.Px3e Px6f   30.Sx6f P'6g   31.K5h
[ 31.Kx6g is not good because of a possible knight drop on 5e. The pawn
  on 3e signifies a bigger advantage for black than the pawn on 6g does
  for white, because white's stronghold can easily be eliminated.]
   31. ... S2c   32.P5f
[ Black's plan is to play S5g/R6i/Rx6g, which gives him an extra pawn and
  a better positioned rook, but white attacks quicker.]
   32. ... P1e   33.Px1e P'1h   34.Lx1h P'1g   35.Lx1g N'2e   36.L1f
[ Black can play neither 36.R1i (because of 36. ... B'2h) nor 36.R2g
  (because of 36. ... B'1h).]
   36. ... N1g+   37.R1i +Nx1f   38.Rx1f
[ Mr. Tsukada had not realised that 37.R1i was possible. This makes his
  whole edge attack unsound. Instead of 37. ... +Nx1f both +N2g and B'2h
  give black the advantage: 37. ... +N2g   38.R6i B'2f   39.S5g with Rx6g
  to follow, or 37. ... B'2h   38.R2i +N1h   39.R6i B1g+   40.Rx6g +Bx1f
  41.S7e and in both cases white has no pawn in hand ("fugire"), which
  makes defending very difficult. So 37. ... +Nx1f is the only move.]
   38. ... B'3i (threatening P6h+ next)  39.S5g B2h+   40.G3h
[ This last move is inaccurate, because black could now break decisively
  into the enemy camp by: 40.P1d Lx1d   41.P'1e +B2g. If 41. ... Lx1e
  then 42.Rx1e L'1d   43.P3d Lx1e (43. ... G3cx3d   44.R6e) 44.Px3c+. So
  white must play 41. ... +B2g   42.R1i P'3f   43.Px1d P3g+   44.P1c+
  +Px4h   45.Sx4h G'6h   46.K5g Gx7h   47.+Px2c P6h+. Black declined this
  variation, because he saw no winning sequence from the position after
  47. ... P6h+. In the analysis afterwards the following was found:
  48.R1a+ L'2a   49.S'2b K4a   50.+Rx2a K5b   51.B'4a K6b   52.L'6e K7b
  53.L6c+ K8c. The pointe is that black can defend now with 54.P'6g
  because white's rook is blocked by his king. He has a clear win after
  this sequence. 40.G3h gives white the chance to exchange his bishop for
  a gold at anytime.]
   40. ... +B2i   41.P1d Sx1d   42.P3d G3cx3d   43.N'2f G2e   44.Nx1d
   Gx1f   45.N'3e G4b   46.P'3c K4a
[ White cannot play 46. ... P6h+, because of 47.Gx6h Rx8g+   48.S'3b Gx3b
  49.Px3b+ Kx3b   50.B'4c K4b (50. ... K4a   51.G'5b K3a   52.N2c mate)
  51.G'5b K3c   52.Gx5c and black will win. After 46. ... P6h+   47.Kx6h
  does not work, because black will lose his most important attacking
  piece, the knight on 3e, after 47. ... R'6e.]
   47.P3b+ Gx3b (if Kx3b then 48.B'2c and mate on the next move)
   48.B'7a R5b   49.S'4c P6h+
[ White has to play P6h+ now in order to be able to defend the sixth
  file.]
   50.Gx6h G4b   51.P'6d L'6b
[ 51. ... P'6b is to passive a defence: 52.P6c+ Px6c   53.P'6d Px6d
  54.Sx5b+ Kx5b   55.R'8b and black will win easily.]
   52.Sx4b+ Sx4b   53.G'6c P'6a   54.N2b+ R'7i   55.Gx5b
[ If 55.+N3b Kx3b   56.Gx5b S3a white has counter-attacking chances.
  Also, his king might escape. So black avoids this dangerous variation.]
   55. ... Kx5b   56.+N3b Lx6d
[ After e.g. 56. ... Rx8i+   57.+Nx4b white would be mated so Lx6d is the
  only move.]
   57.P'6e Lx6e
[ 57. ... S'4i   58.K6g Lx6e   59.P'6f Rx8i+ threatens mate with 60. ...
  +Rx8g etc., but black is quicker: 60.+Nx4b K6c and 61.R'8b threatens
  "tsume" (mate by consecutive checks) and defends 8g at the same time !]
   58.+Nx4b K6c   59.P'6d Kx6d
[ If 59. ... K7b then 60.S'6c and if 59. ... K7d then 60.S'7e.]
   60.R'8d P7d   61.S'5c Resigns.
