# A Already I am in an awkward position with my bishop and left silver
#   paralyzed. But coming out of the opening with a disadvantage is default for
#   me. I will just have to make up for it in the middle game.
# B Mr. Nishikawa said: this is normally the wrong position for the left gold,
#   but later it will play a very interesting role !
# C Ms. Hayashi can play 19... R6d, but she was reluctant since this overloads
#   her rook while it also releases the pressure on my position that is exerted
#   over the 8th file.
# D 26.P7d is a crucial move. Although the silver and bishop are still
#   inactive, swings the balance slightly in my favour.
# E During the game I was hesitating between P'5d and P'5h. 34.P'5h after which
#   might follow 34... B4b with the threat 35... R6d is safer, but may throw
#   away the slight edge I had. Mr. Nishikawa said that 34.P'5d is allright.
# F 36.Gx4h is a terrible blunder. Europeans are weak in the end game and I am
#   the living proof that that is true both for attack and defence ! With this
#   move I help Ms. Hayashi's attack: I lose a move and at the same time bring
#   her tokin (promoted pawn) closer. 36.+P4c Gx4i 37.Sx4i leads to an unclear
#   game where I still have good chances.
# G Even 44.P2f does not help anymore: 44... Sx2i 45.K2g N'3e 46.K3f S'4e.
