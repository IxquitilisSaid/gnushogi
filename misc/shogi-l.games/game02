# Shogi Game 2 (amateur game, some amateur comment).
# 
# The game below was played at the sixth International Utrecht (the Netherlands)
# tournament, October 1984 and features the strongest European player Mike
# Sandeman, now already for more than a year living in Japan. His style is very
# flamboyant and this time he played an old and speculative opening. He allows
# his opponent to exchange rook pawns and, contrary to the proverb, keeps his
# rook and king together. He hardly makes a localized castle for his king, but
# instead puts up sort of an aerial (or area) defence. Jan Oosterwijk, one of
# Holland's Shogi nestors, builds a standard three-generals castle known as
# "yagura". Among other things "yagura" can mean: arsenal or scaffold. In
# English literature it is sometimes translated as fortress, but normally the
# Japanese term is used. The "yagura" is hard to break down with a frontal
# attack, but is weak at the side. It is therefore almost solely employed in
# double static rook games. The comment below the game was provided by Mike
# Loftus, 3-dan and published in "Shoten" (=focal point), the quarterly
# journal of the British Shogi Federation.

# (A) Rather than let white have his own way, black can try 23.P'2d Px2d
#     (otherwise 24.Px2c+ Gx2c and 25.S3e or S1e looks fast) 24.S1e and
#     black looks better to me.
# (B) Presumably to attack up the 4th file, but it looks rather negative.
# (C) White sacrifices a silver for a purely positional advantage.
# (D) Perhaps K7i and early escape might have been expedient.
#     Subsequently, Mike went on to win the tournament with 6 straight
#     wins.
