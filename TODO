Generic cleanups

- switch cli parsing to getopt
- hunt for extern's and prototypes spread all over the source
- merge old Makefile.profile.in back into Makefile.in if meaningful at all
- use automake
- drop gnushogi.lng, merge strings back into code
- use version from configure.ac, get rid of version.h, drop patchlevel
- hunt for more hardcoded variant-specific constants
  - position of captured pieces in curses mode
  - compile with bound-checker
- add autosave mode to ease hunt for segfaults ?
- use 2D array for the board, get rid of the (i)nunmap stuff
- fixup build procedure to support parallel make runs
- investigate those preexisting "overflow in implicit constant
  conversion" warnings

Minishogi-related stuff

- make minishogi a run-time option rather than a compile-time one
- minishogi patterns
- tune difficulty levels
- other tunings to investigate
  * PromotionZoneDistanceBonus
